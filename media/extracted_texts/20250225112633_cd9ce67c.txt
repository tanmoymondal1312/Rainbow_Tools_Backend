EXAMPLE: Too much text on one
slide is not effective.
If you too much text on one slide it is
hard to read, and you end up reading
instead of presenting your entire
presentation This can make your show
seem very monotone and can lead to
extreme boredom afflicting your audience.
Your message will be lost in an
abundance of information and ultimately
an extremely ineffective use of this
communication tool. Don't be wordyl
