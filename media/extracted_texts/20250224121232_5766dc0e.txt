Hello  want to make a macro for my
bluestacks 5,
I have a couple of servers that i want to
run multiple instances of bluestacks on, Im
trying to a script made that would open
the spotify app; log in from a list of accounts
that i have, add a playlist that i specify and
stream from the playlist, whilst also randomly
throughout a long playtime liking only some
songs, and skipping some of the music, or
skipping 15- 30 seconds f a song:
Can this script have no resolution
requirements (like that it doesnt matter what
size the screen resolution is)
get
